<h2>Code Description and Output</h2>

<h2 id="odd-even">01. Write a Python program to find the sum of odd and even numbers from a
set of numbers.</h2>
<p>This program takes a predefined list of numbers and calculates the sum of odd and even numbers separately.
It iterates through the list, checks each number's parity and adds it to the corresponding sum.</p>
<p><strong>Example Input:</strong></p>
<pre>list: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]</pre>
<p><strong>Example Output:</strong></p>
<pre>Sum of Even: 56</pre>
<pre>Sum of Odd: 64</pre>


<h2 id="smallest-number">02. Write a Python program to find the smallest number from a set of
numbers.</h2>
<p>This program finds the smallest number in a given list. It initializes a variable with the first number in the list
and iterates through the remaining numbers, updating the smallest value whenever a smaller number is found.</p>
<p><strong>Example Input:</strong></p>
<pre>list: [5,4,3,4,2,1,9,8,7]</pre>
<p><strong>Example Output:</strong></p>
<pre>Smallest Number is 1</pre>


<h2 id="sum-divisible">03. Write a Python program to find the sum of all numbers between 50 and
100, which are divisible by 3 and not divisible by 5.</h2>
<p>This program calculates the sum of numbers in the range of 50 to 100 that are divisible by 3 but not by 5.
It iterates through the range, checks each number's divisibility conditions, and sums up the valid numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Example Output:</strong></p>
<pre>Total Sum: 735</pre>


<h2 id="second-highest">04. Write a Python program to find the second-highest number from a set of
numbers.</h2>
<p>This program determines both the highest and second-highest numbers in a given list.
It first sorts the list in descending order and then picks the first and second elements as the highest and second-highest values.</p>
<p><strong>Example Input:</strong></p>
<pre>list: [5,4,3,4,2,1,9,8,7]</pre>
<p><strong>Example Output:</strong></p>
<pre>Highest Number is 9</pre>
<pre>Second Highest Number is 8</pre>


<h2 id="factorial">05. Write a Python program to find the factorial of a number using for loop.</h2>
<p>This program calculates the factorial of a user-inputted number using a loop.
The factorial of a number (n!) is the product of all positive integers up to that number.
For example, 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24.</p>
<p><strong>Example Input:</strong></p>
<pre>Enter any positive integer number: 5</pre>
<p><strong>Example Output:</strong></p>
<pre>The factorial of 5 is: 120</pre>


<h2 id="fibonacci">06. Write a Python program to generate Fibonacci series.</h2>
<p>This program generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.
The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
For example, the first 6 terms are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5.</p>
<p><strong>Example Input:</strong></p>
<pre>Enter the number of terms: 6</pre>
<p><strong>Example Output:</strong></p>
<pre>Fibonacci numbers: 0 1 1 2 3 5</pre>

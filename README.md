<h2>Code Description and Output</h2>

<h2 id="odd-even">01. Write a Python program to find the sum of odd and even numbers from a
set of numbers.</h2>
<p>This program takes a predefined list of numbers and calculates the sum of odd and even numbers separately.
It iterates through the list, checks each number's parity and adds it to the corresponding sum.</p>
<p><strong>Example Input:</strong></p>
<pre>list: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]</pre>
<p><strong>Example Output:</strong></p>
<pre>Sum of Even: 56</pre>
<pre>Sum of Odd: 64</pre>


<h2 id="smallest-number">02. Write a Python program to find the smallest number from a set of
numbers.</h2>
<p>This program finds the smallest number in a given list. It initializes a variable with the first number in the list
and iterates through the remaining numbers, updating the smallest value whenever a smaller number is found.</p>
<p><strong>Example Input:</strong></p>
<pre>list: [5,4,3,4,2,1,9,8,7]</pre>
<p><strong>Example Output:</strong></p>
<pre>Smallest Number is 1</pre>


<h2 id="sum-divisible">03. Write a Python program to find the sum of all numbers between 50 and
100, which are divisible by 3 and not divisible by 5.</h2>
<p>
This program calculates the sum of numbers in the range of 50 to 100 that are divisible by 3 but not by 5.
It iterates through the range, checks each number's divisibility conditions, and sums up the valid numbers.
</p>
<p><strong>Example Output:</strong></p>
<pre>Total Sum: 735</pre>


<h2 id="second-highest">04. Write a python program to find the second-highest number from a set of
numbers.</h2>
<p>
This program determines both the highest and second-highest numbers in a given list.
It first sorts the list in descending order and then picks the first and second elements as the highest and second-highest values.
</p>
<p><strong>Example Input:</strong></p>
<pre>list: [5,4,3,4,2,1,9,8,7]</pre>
<p><strong>Example Output:</strong></p>
<pre>Highest Number is 9</pre>
<pre>Second Highest Number is 8</pre>
